              <p class="text-justify">The first three months is Iideation Stage. In this stage we help startup founders research, develop and test their ideas. We do this through number of ideation workshops, where our experienced CEO mentors work with the founders on their ideas. Each founder is supposed to pitch their ideas to the mentors and receive feedback which they can use to refine their business ideas. All work carried out by founders is reviewed by mentors. We recruitrecruite around 100 founders in our ideation program each year. You are not required to quit your day job in order to participate in our ideation sessions.</p>
